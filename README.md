# AI Engineer Curriculum

This curriculum gives you an overview of what you need to learn to build AI-powered apps. It is meant for aspiring AI engineers, as opposed to AI researchers. So this guide is does not teach you to build and train neural networks, but rather to evaluate, apply and productize pre-trained AI models.

## AI Engineering basics
* What is an AI model
* What types of models exist?
* How to evaluate different models
* Tools and playgrounds for evaluating models
* Inference
* System message
* Fine-tuninig
* Tokens
* Temperature
* Stop sequence
* Zero-shot
* Few-shot
* Frequency & presence penalty

## Embeddings and Vector Databases
* What is an embedding? What problem(s) do they solve?
* How to create text embeddings
* Text splitting
* Vector databases (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate)
* Semantic search
* Long-term memory


## AI Agents
* OpenAI functions
* Chain-of-thought prompting
* Reasoning & Acting (ReAct)
* Plan-and-executre
